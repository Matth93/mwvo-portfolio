description: Party Reel is a marketplace that connects contracted photographers with live music event attendees for personalized photography. On this project I work as a developer. The app is build in Ruby on Rails. <br><br> PartyReel partners with music festivals and concerts by placing our staff photographers onsite for their event attendees to book personal photography services.  Party Reel acts as a broker by receiving a commision for each booking to account for payment processing and the existing festival partnerships.
