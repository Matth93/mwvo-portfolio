description: An IMDB web scraper that scans over your personal page with rated movies and finds the corresponding budget for this particular film. I made this to practise webscraping and better understand the structure of HTML-webpages. As an improvement I could also find the rating the user has given the film and analyse whether or not there is a relation between the budget of a movie and oneâ€™s appreciation for it.
