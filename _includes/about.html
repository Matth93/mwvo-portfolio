                          Born and raised in the Netherlands I graduated with a degree in Military History from Leiden University and the University of Amsterdam. After graduating, instead of landing a job in the field of history, I was drawn into the world of coding. I started working for <a href="https://www.calco.nl/">Calco</a>, a company specialised in getting people without a relevant education their first job in IT.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          On my first job I ended up programming mainframes. Here I fell in love with backend coding. This motivated me to start studying <a href="https://www.ou.nl/info-bachelor-informatica">Computer Science at the Open Universiteit</a>. Doing this parttime is going to take me several years. But on this site I keep track of my progress.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          After two years, however, I wanted to get more experience in a recent field. To learn more about contemporary topics I signed up for a Web Development course from <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> (Bali, batch #349, January - March  2020). Where I learned to be a full stack Ruby on Rails developer in 9 weeks. This turned out to be an amazing experience and confirmed me to dedicate all of my time to coding.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Now I’m educating myself constantly by following courses, building websites for friends and working on my own personal projects. On this site I keep track of my education, certificates and the projects I do for fun.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          As a programmer I care about writing high quality code, where every line is written knowing ‘why’ it needs to be there. By constantly improving myself I want to learn how to fully utilise the potential of the digital age.
